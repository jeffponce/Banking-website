# Website Design for Financial Services/Blog

Financial services business website with a blog section with various articles that customers can read through. Starting to work with more complex tools such as Flexbox, Lightbox to highlight pictures on the website, and adding Javascript to transition navigation bar to change from transparent to dark gray as you scroll down the page. Working with classes and CSS to allow sections to be designed faster and learned to add the Favicon for the website.
